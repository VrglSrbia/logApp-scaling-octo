MySQL Workbench: Database Migration

 > **DESCRIPTION**


The MySQL Workbench Migration Wizard is designed to save DBA and developer time by providing visual, point and click ease of use around all phases of configuring and managing a complex migration process:

Improved! Database migrations - enables migrations from Microsoft SQL Server, Microsoft Access, PostgreSQL, Sybase ASE, Sybase SQL Anywhere, SQLite, and more.
Manage Migration Projects - allows migrations to be configured, copied, edited, executed and scheduled.
Source and Target selection - allows users to define specific data sources and to analyze source data in advance of the migration.
Object migration - allows users to select objects to migrate, assign source to target mappings where needed, edit migration scripts and create the target schema.
Version Upgrades - using migration users can easily move databases off older MySQL versions to the latest.
